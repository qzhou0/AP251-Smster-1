// Java has much more "punctuations" needed than in
/* Python and Scheme, with multitudes of built-in-functions or variables (?) 
needed. There is no specific "define" in this function, and when ran, at least 
for the present, it does not produce any results directly, but seems to want
to open something. However,  they both seem to have an opening and closing. */
