Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
* dramatic music and huge pictures!
* Earth - Solar System - Milky Way Galaxy - Local group - Virgo cluster -- Observable Universe - Multiverse?
** Did homo sapiens really send that music player into space??? Why didn't it include some other musical styles?
** Rogue planets are frozen invisible-to-human-eyes planets, in middle of which may be oceans (infra red)
*** Could be a good setting for some story
* There was actually someone between Copernicus and Gallileo who envisioned an infinite universe but was persecuted by almost all Christian sects
** Infinity used for spiritual means
** Used modern images of outer space to illustrate the mind of a Christian spiritual, which were probably un-accessible/un-imaginable to him
** Why did this video about scientific cosmos bother about a non-scientist visionary/spiritual?
** So non-Science can also be productive! (despite low success rate)
** The other believers (Catholics, Englishman,etc.) seem demonized or villainized. This propanganda-ish portrayal makes its protagonists less believable.
* This episode tried to let us envision Big Time and Big Space
* in 12 months analogy, March was creation of stars, August of Solar System, and near the end of December humans, art last 60 seconds, last 7th second Moses, 6th Buddha, 5th Jesus, 3rd Mohammad, last science
** procrastination actually works! (at least universe scale)
** Some small distance of an inch made dinosaurs die countless years after
* Science is like a torch, passed on generations on
** Did not specify purpose of science -- why should we, not even dusts in all that, care?
** If we are made of stars, we are made of stars. This does not explain non-material things, nor why should we care--if we already are what we are seeking to explain, why bother explain?
* Mr. Brown willeth us see this why?
** It's very beautiful and intense musically
** To give us an idea how to make big images?
** To communicate life lessons.
** How computers might be helpful in analyzing huge datas. Or how better computers would be needed to not crash over huge numbers.
** Why small inches could be very significant
** A greater scale RPG?
** Maybe there is some connection between science and computer science.

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------
* This episode seems a history of heroes, Newton and Hailey
** Do not have the explicit scientific laws but only a broad explaination that "it is discovered" by "whom" 
** Did not include social context of discovery (I have read somewhere that science is fueled by social factors)
** The episode did not really explain the discoveries and their scientific implications
** Only focused on science, yet its title suggests a societal improvement that if you know stuff, you are not afraid. Now it seems you also get depressed.
** Newton and Hailey's discoveries were probably elite consumption back then until the full popularization Enlightenment
*** Should focus less on heroes and more on how science spread, since knowlege must be known to conquer fear.

* A comet have an icy surface with gases and dust trapped inside it, and when it comes nigh the sun the ice melts and its interiors vomits out to form the tails. If ice be there no more, comet turns into an asteroid
** Comet accelerates near sun
** Comets usually symbolize death of leader, famine, disease, war
*** This could be a self-fufilling prophecy? (especially war?)
* Newton was a mystic and genius
** In addition to being a mathematical genius, he practiced alchemy, studied ancient languages and sought to decode the Bible, which requires a lot of faith that there's something measurable out there
** His discoveries would not have been published if it were not for Hailey's discovery of him
** Hook, inventor of Hook's Law, attempted to accuse him of copying
*** I would not have any idea of what is he talking about if I did not take physics, which means it could be explained better
** Did not suppport or debunk the apple myth
** Why did Newton undertake to calculate about planetary motion if he also tried to calculate the Bible, and where did he get his sources to read except philosphers
** Since this is a scientific-popularization series, why was there no honorary mention about Leibniz, who also invented Calculus?
* Hailey encouraged Newton to write the Principia and helped him publish it 
** Hailey was a loyal member of the London Scientific Society and recieved wages in fish books because the society was nearly bankrupt
*** Why would anyone think fish pictures sells good?
** He was sent to map Earth's magnetic field
** How could Hailey describe where in a sky some comets would come, and find its path in the sky from ancients 1800 years ago exactly as described
*** How do you even describe the exact pathway of something?
** Without computers, Hailey undertook his task. Does it mean that visualizing stuff inside helps your intellect?
* Milky Way and its neighbor would merge in some billion years
* This is a very entertaining series.
